## I protect you. You protect me

Out And Aboot - A simple COVID-19 checklist to help keep each other safe.

Check it out here [https://mightyweasel.github.io/OutAndAboot/](https://mightyweasel.github.io/OutAndAboot/)

Ultra basic checklist. Personal passion project. Not medical advice. Not mandated. No authority 
is mine. BUT... My safety is in your hands. Yours is in mine. Let's be a team. I protect
you, you protect me. I think this can help keep people safe. That's why it put it together.
 
Stay safe, stay healthy. Be empathetic and compassionate.

## Follow the ABCs
### A
Always Wash Your Hands

### B
Be sure to keep distance (2m or more)

### C
Cover your face with a mask. Cloth works. But it protects others. You need a team.

Let's be a team.
